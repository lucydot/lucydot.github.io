We are based at Northumbria University in the beautiful North East of England, and participate in the [Northumbria University Photovoltaics group](https://sites.google.com/view/nupv), [Energy Futures](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/mathematics-physics-and-electrical-engineering/research/renewable-energy-technologies-and-materials/) and the [North East Centre for Energy Materials](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/necem/).

<b>Come work with me!</b> </big>

A funded PhD is available - for more information please see the the advert [here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/atomic-scale-simulation-of-next-generation-thermoelectric-materials-renu-26-se-epm-whalley/?p192725). It is a computational project exploring a group of materials called perovskites, and it is co-supervised by Emma McCabe at Durham [Lucy = computers, Emma = perovskites]. I strongly encourage potential applicants to contact me ahead of any submission - for UK-based applicants there is the opportunity to visit the group (with expenses paid) to find out more.

<b>Opportunities</b> </big>

We are always interested in hearing from potential new members and collaborators - [please get in touch](https://lucydot.github.io/about/). 

Any PhD/job opportunities will be listed here, and, for the right candidate, there is also the possibility to apply for external funding (e.g. the [Marie Curie IF](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en)).

For smaller undergraduate, postgraduate and summer placement projects please see a project list that I maintain [here](https://lucydot.github.io/projects_list/).
