I am based at Northumbria University in the beautiful North East of England, and am a member of [Northumbria University Photovoltaics group](https://sites.google.com/view/nupv), [Energy Futures](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/mathematics-physics-and-electrical-engineering/research/renewable-energy-technologies-and-materials/) and the [North East Centre for Energy Materials](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/necem/).

<b>Supervision</b> </big>

Prakriti Kayastha - PhD student - *Atomistic modelling of disorder and defects in energy materials* </br>

Michael Jones - PhD student - *Interface Engineering in CZTS thin film solar cells* </br>

<b>Opportunities</b> </big>

I am always interested in hearing from potential new members and collaborators - [please get in touch](https://lucydot.github.io/about/). 

Any PhD/job opportunities will be listed here, and, for the right candidate, there is also the possibility to apply for external funding (e.g. the [Marie Curie IF](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en)).

For smaller undergraduate, postgraduate and summer placement projects please see a project list that I maintain [here](https://lucydot.github.io/projects_list/).
