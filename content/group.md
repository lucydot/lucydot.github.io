<b>Opportunities</b> </big>

I am always interested in hearing from potential new members and collaborators - [please get in touch](https://lucydot.github.io/about/). 

Any PhD/job opportunities will be listed here, and, for the right candidate, there is also the possibility to apply for external funding (e.g. the [Marie Curie IF](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en)).

For smaller undergraduate, postgraduate and summer placement projects please see a project list that I maintain [here](https://lucydot.github.io/projects_list/).
