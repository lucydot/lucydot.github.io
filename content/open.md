"Open" is a bit of a buzz-word at the moment: open source, open access, open data... but openness *is* necessary for scientific progress and the focus on open science is long overdue. Open science leads to:

- efficient use of money and researcher time (less duplication)
- a more equal scientific community (as some scientists do not have the resources to go to conferences or pay for journal subscriptions) 
- reproducible research (see Stodden et al. ["Setting the Default to Reproducible"](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf)). 

I also think that working openly could benefit me personally as a researcher (see ["How open science helps researchers succeed"](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554%2FeLife.16800)).

So one of my targets is to work more openly, and encourage those around me to do the same: to make our [papers](https://lucydot.github.io/publications), [software code](https://github.com/lucydot/), [slides](https://lucydot.github.io/slides) and [funding applications](https://lucydot.github.io/applications) available. As a [fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/lucy-whalley) I hope to learn more about working openly, and encourage more scientists to publish their research code.
