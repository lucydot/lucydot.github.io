I currently teach a second year undergraduate course in Computational Physics (materials are [in development](https://github.com/NU-CEM/CompPhys)) and a graduate level course for physical scientists that is inspired by [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/). I am also developing a Github-based checklist tool for educators called [ChooChoo](https://github.com/lucydot/choochoo).

My teaching materials are below, and I strongly welcome *any* feedback - thoughts, comments, questions. If you use any of these materials I'd love to [hear from you](https://lucydot.github.io/about/).
