I currently teach a second year undergraduate course in Computational Physics (materials are [in development](https://github.com/NU-CEM/CompPhys)) and a graduate level course that is inspired by [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/). My teaching materials are below, and I strongly welcome *any* feedback - thoughts, comments, questions. If you use any of these materials I'd love to hear from you.
