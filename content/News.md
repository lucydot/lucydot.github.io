<b>2021</b></br>

<b> 12th July </b><br>
Today I'm speaking about our latest paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" at the 15th International conference on materials chemistry (MC15). For those that couldn't attend you can find a recording of the same presentation [here](https://vimeo.com/575352468).

<b> 10th June </b><br>
I'm pleased to say that our paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" has been published open-access in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

<b> 6th May </b><br>
A pre-print for our new paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" is [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02097). In this paper we analyse the quantum mechanics of carrier trapping at an abundant defect in the prototype hybrid perovskite "MAPI". Our main finding is that there is large lattice relaxation after carrier capture, leading to a Huang-Rhys factor (a proxy for electron-phonon coupling) exceeding 300 and fast electron capture. This suggests that suppression of the large octahedral rotations associated with the lead-iodide cage is an important factor to enhance photovoltaic performance. 

<b> 7th April </b><br>
Next week (14/4) I'm speaking at the Institute of Physics conference ["Lessons Learnt in Lockdown: Teaching computational physics in 2020 and beyond"](http://lessonslearnedinlockdown.iopconfs.org/1021126). I'll introduce the pedagogy used in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lessons, and reflect on a carpentry-based workshop I have delivered both in and out of lockdown, [Python for Physicists](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice/). Software Carpentry takes inspiration from the world of open-source software, developing lesson materials collaboratively and making them available for anyone to re-use, adapt and extend. I dream of a future where most university education is developed and delivered in a similar way...

<b> 8th March </b><br>
We've just released a new version of [effmass](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass) with support for FHI-aims calculations. Thanks to Matthias Golomb for contributing the necessary code. Castep is next, watch this space. UPDATE: effmass 2.0.0 supports Vasp, Castep, FHI-aims and ASE. It also comes with a command line interface..

<b> 16th February </b></br>
Welcome to Kiran and Kishore, who are working with me as part of the Electrical Engineering Advanced Practice programme at Northumbria. They will be using the [SMACT software package](https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT) to screen for new spinel compounds.

<b> 17th January </b></br>
I'm now a full member of the [Materials Chemistry Consortium](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/mcc/). What does this mean? That I (and other member of [NUPV](https://sites.google.com/view/nupv)) can apply for computer time on the [Archer2](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/) and [Young](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Young/) supercomputers - let's get diagonalising..

<b>2020</b></br>

<b> 1st December </b></br>
Work with me! A funded PhD is available  - for more information please see the [Group page](https://lucydot.github.io/group).

<b> 23rd November</b></br>
I'm preparing to deliver my first online teaching session, and first time teaching as a faculty member. It's a course I'm familiar with ([Programming in Python](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice), adapted from the Software Carpentry course), but I'm wondering how well the "live coding" approach will work: me talking + screenshare with the code I am typing + students' jupyter notebook + chat window / website / other useful course materials seems a lot for a small laptop screen...

<b> 10th November</b> </br>
I'll be delivering a seminar at the University of Oklahoma Centre for Quantum Research and Technology this Friday (13th November). I'll be talking about nonparabolic effective mass, and the effect this has on the optical and transport properties of photovoltaic materials - the corresponding paper is [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.085207).  

<b> 1st October</b> </br>
It's my first day back from maternity leave. I'm thinking about my strategy for the next three years, writing applications for computer time and (virtually) meeting with my new colleagues at Northumbria University. Pleased to be back on board.

<b>31st July</b> </br>
Our quick-start guide for first-principles modelling of point defects has been published in JPhys Energy. The paper is Open Access and available [here](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7655/aba081).

<b>1st June</b> </br>
Today is my first official day as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow at Northumbria University. I'm on maternity leave until October, but happy to stop thinking about baby Robin for a little while and attend the online induction events. With lots of events moving online it's been easy for me to keep a toe in the academic waters.

<b>12th March</b></br>
Our CarrierCapture.jl software has been accepted for publication with [the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). The accompanying paper can be found [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02102).

<b>17th March</b></br>
I have been awarded the [Thomas Young Centre](https://www.thomasyoungcentre.org/) at Imperial prize: "An annual award to the student who has demonstrated the most important and innovative contribution to research in the Theory and Simulation of Materials". A special thanks to the Walsh group post-docs who worked with and supported me through my PhD (including [Jarvist Frost](https://jarvist.github.io/), [Jonathan Skelton](https://skelton-group.github.io/), [Sunghyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=v438vEAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Ji-Sang Park](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ZCmm3y8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Hood](https://www.samanthahood.com.au/)). I think the prize money should be spent on thousands of Lindt Lindor chocolates.

<b>13th January</b></br>
I have been awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy! It's been the most productive four years of my life, and very enjoyable to boot: a huge thanks to my supervisor [Prof. Aron Walsh and his team](http://wmd-group.github.io/) at Imperial College London.

<b>1st January</b></br>
I'm currently on maternity leave until October 2020 - wish me luck! <img src="./images/baby_icon.png" height="30"> 

<b>2019</b></br>

<b>25th November</b></br>
I'm happy to announce that I will be joining Northumbria University as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow in the department of [Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/mathematics-physics-and-electrical-engineering/research/), and aligned with the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). I'm very excited to see what future research projects and collaborations will bring!

<b>14th November</b></br>
Today I'm teaching version control using Git at Imperial College London. It's fully booked but you can follow the material yourself using the course webpage which is [here](https://kmichali.github.io/2019-11-14-Imperial/) and the slides which are [here](https://lucydot.github.io/slides/1911_git/SWC_git_1911.pdf).

<b>5th October</b></br>
From the 5th October until the 9th of November I will be visiting the [Laboratory for Materials and Structures](https://www.msl.titech.ac.jp/english/member/profile/oba_en.html) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. We hope to develop software for the high-throughput calculation of non-radiative recombination rates, and builds on the [CarrierCapture software](https://github.com/WMD-group/CarrierCapture.jl) developed by the Walsh group at Imperial. 

<b>1st October</b></br>
From the 5th of October 2019 until the 26th of January 2020 DotSpace will be exhibited at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, The Row Gallery and Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum as part of the Coventry Biennial.  To accompany the exhibition I am developing a DotSpace web app (aka The Grain Generator) so that visitors can generate their own DotSpace picture - the web app can be found [here](https://boiling-peak-32563.herokuapp.com/voila/render/dotspace.ipynb). More information about the exhibition can be found [here](https://www.theherbert.org/whats_on/1490/coventry_biennial__the_twin).
