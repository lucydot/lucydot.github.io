<b>2025</b></br>

<b> 1st October </br>

A wonderful visit to Singapore to speak about our latest research at the Global Conference for Women Leaders and Emerging Researchers in Materials Science ([GLOW](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mse/news-events/events/glow2025)). The materials science on offer here is broad---biomimicry, generative AI, smart materials and microfactories---but everything is made to feel accessible as the quality of the talks is high and each is well-pitched. 

<b> 11th September </b>

Today we (the Sonnic Intangibles team) are hosting a workshop: "Can we bring your data to life through sound?". We have researchers and artists joining us from across the UK and, as an interdisciplinary project, we're often working outside our comfort zone. In my case, this "outside my comfort zone" is ethnography work observing the workshop participants and how they/we interact.

<b> 1st August </b>

Very pleased to announce that I've been promoted to Associate Professor :) 

<b> 30th June </b>

I'm in Coimbra for the joint conference of [Audio Mostly and the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD)](https://icad2025.icad.org/). There are a fair few of us from the [Sonic Intangibles](https://sonicintangibles.github.io/) team, including Shelly who led a workshop showing how to stitch together Sonification and Live Coding using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/). It's a relatively accessible way into making sonifications (for those already familiar with coding), and I'm keen to apply this approach to some quantum chemical data soon.

<b> 10th June </b>

Gearing up to host researchers across the North East for [Re:Search and Industry](https://lu.ma/hb04n9dm) tomorrow. [Nav Dean](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/about/the-divisional-office/our-team/nav-dean) and I are organising this event after speaking about how we might encourage more research funding to wing its way into this corner of the country. We have a great line-up: Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering, ICURe, and two North East impact accelerators ([NESCA](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/nesca/) and [NNZA](https://nnza.ac.uk/)). And 110 people are registered from regional institutions: Northumbria, Newcastle, Durham, Teesside and Hull. It's shaping up to be a nice event.

<b> 23rd May </b>

I'm at the end of a particularly busy week, with Erik visiting from Chalmers, followed by our Sonic Intangibles / Pint of Science collab evening, and then launch of the SCALE-UP project in London. SCALE-UP is one of the new Digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) Skills Networks funded by UKRI. The network is led by Imperial, with the co-lead team spread throughout the UK; I'm representing the North East. The project is centred around building a more sustainable dRTP people pipeline through a ¬£1M flexible fund. We are currently in start-up mode, more details coming soon...

<b> 15th May </b>

Next week we (the [Sonic Intangibles](https://sonicintangibles.github.io/people/) team and [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/)) are hosting a (sold-out!) evening dedicated to Sonification.  The evening is titled ‚ÄúThe Sounds of Science‚Äù and will be held at [The Common Room](https://thecommonroom.org.uk/about-the-common-room/) in Newcastle. Aimed at a public audience, we will will take a sonic journey through science with talks and performances that represent a broad range of fleeting physical and biological phenomena through sound ‚Äî from distant galaxies, to brain signals and Earth cycles. For more information please see [the event page](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/the-sounds-of-science). My contribution will be a short demonstration of sonified phonon data.

<b> 7th May </b>

In Durham today to deliver a seminar titled "Chalcogenide perovskites - a new class of functional materials?". I'll be discussing our work joint with the Chalmers group, exploring BaZrS3 and friends (BaZr(S,Se)3 and the Ruddlesden-Popper phases). One of the nice things about the North East of England is that we have three research intensive universities very close together - Newcastle University is a 5 minute walk away, Durham is 20 minutes on the train. So we have a healthy research environment, even though we are in a relatively remote corner of England.

<b> 10th March </b>

Our new paper [Thermodynamic insights into the Ba‚ÄìS system for the formation of BaZrS3 perovskites and other Ba sulfides](https://doi.org/10.1039/D5TA00798D) has been published in Journal of Materials Chemistry A. It is a collaboration and project led by [Corrado Comparotto](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N18-2182) and [Jonathan Scragg](https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N10-969) at Uppsala University. We combine experiment and theory to produce a pressure-temperature phase diagram for the Ba‚ÄìS system, defining the domains of stability of binary Ba sulfides.

<b> 3rd March </b>

[Giulia Longo](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1163-1110) and I are organising a symposium to discuss [chalcogenide materials for photovoltaics](https://www.nanoge.org/MATSUSSpring25/symposia?t=6682635b3aab4d6a2ce8b763) in beautiful, rainy Seville. 
One of the scientific highlights is learning about kesterite materials for application in space photovoltaics. 
One of the culinary highlights is having salad served with a small scoop of fig ice-cream.

<b> 1st February </b>

It is the official start date for our [Sonic Intangibles](https://sonicintangibles.github.io/) project. We are exploring how sonification (communicating data through sound) might be established as an interdiscipline, and will be engaging with a variety of research domains. I also want to understand how we can better listen to our [Singing Materials](https://github.com/NU-CEM/singing-materials).

<b> 31st January </b>

At the end of another wonderful edition of the [Rising Stars in Materials Science](https://www.royce.ac.uk/events/rising-stars-2025/) workshop at the Henry Royce Institute. So many people exchanging stories, ideas and contacts.

<b>2024</b></br>

<b> 2nd December </b>

At the start of a very-mini seminar tour of the UK Midlands, to visit Warwick and Loughborough Universities. I will be presenting our latest research exploring [Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS3 chalcogenide perovskite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14289).

<b> 21st November </b>

Our paper [Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS3 chalcogenide perovskite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14289) is available as a pre-print. This has been enabled through a wonderful collaboration with the [Computational Materials Modelling group](https://materialsmodeling.org/) at Chalmers University in Sweden. It is our first foray into machine-learnt interatomic potentials and I am now very much a convert. Hats off to PhD student [Prakriti Kayastha](https://prakayastha.github.io/) for all the hard work building a model trained with hybrid DFT.

<b> 14th October </b>

[Erik Fransson](https://materialsmodeling.org/people/erik-fransson/) from Chalmers University is visiting us for two weeks. He will deliver a seminar hosted by CDT-ReNU, and brings a wealth of experience in materials modelling and machine learning. 

<b> 7th October </b>

Very chuffed to receive an [APS Reviewer Excellence Award](https://promo.aps.org/reviewer-excellence) for "exceptional contributions that are instrumental to peer review at the Physical Review journals". Writing useful reviews takes time, and it is a largely secret activity, so it feels nice to get some official recognition!

<b> 2nd September </b>

We have published [The Roadmap on established and emerging photovoltaics for sustainable energy conversion](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ad7404) in JPhysEnergy. This has 86 authors, with Robert Hoye leading development of the Roadmap, and Alex Ganose leading the section I contributed to: *Computational materials discovery and design for photovoltaics*. We highlight the need for improved modelling techniques that can more accurately predict device performance - atomistic modelling must consider, for example, defects, ion transport, secondary phases, interfaces, and finite temperature. 

<b> 17th August </b>

We are recruiting two research fellows for the multidisciplinary project "Sonic Intangibles"  based around data sonification---converting data üìä into sound üé∂. See the job adverts [here](https://work4.northumbria.ac.uk/#en/sites/CX_1001/job/2601) (for the more code-leaning position) and [here](https://jobs.ncl.ac.uk/job/Newcastle-Research-Associate-Sonic-Intangibles/1095690301/) (for the more arts-leaning position). 

<b> 3rd July </b>

Back in Daresbury for the [MCC 30th Anniversary Conference](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/MCC-2024/Welcome.htm). I learnt that the Littleton of the [Mott-Littleton method for defect calculations](https://doi.org/10.1039/TF9383400485) was a woman: Marjorie Littleton. There is [so little](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Davis/Names/Littleton_Marjorie.html) information about her online, the most I can find is a short reference to her on [someone else's Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl_May_Dent). Neville Mott also mentions her work in his article [Defect physics and chemistry: some problems awaiting a solution](https://doi.org/10.1039/F29898500517): "Ronald Gurney and I were enormously impressed with the work of Robert Pohl at Gottingen on defects in alkali-metal halides, work which in my view laid the foundation of experimental solid-state physics. We tried to clothe it with elementary quantum mechanics, and also to see if we could show by calculation that Schottky defects had lower energy than Frenkel defects. I remember our departmental librarian and research assistant, Marjorie Littleton, doing the calculations with a Brunsviga machine." What is a Brunsviga machine? [Here](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co59679/brunsviga-calculating-machine) is a description. We've come a long way... 

<b> 4th June </b>

[Visting](https://x.com/scanlond81/status/1797979835001975152) the David Scanlon crew in Birmingham today to talk about defects and dynamics, garnished with a little bit of machine learning.

<b> 16th May </b>

Some nice outreach/communication/dissemination-related news this month. Prakriti gave an invited talk at the [FHI-aims UK meeting](https://logsdail.github.io/fhiaims_meeting_2024/) in some great company. Also for the first time, I presented at [Pint of Science 2024](https://pintofscience.co.uk/event/solar-power-to-the-people) - I'm so chuffed when people choose to spend their evening listening to us chat about our research. We had some great questions also (are defects in the materials important? what role does AI play?). And a nice [Q&A article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48495-8) in Nature Communications following the Rising Stars event at Henry Royce Institute, "Celebrating and supporting early career researchers within underrepresented groups in materials science".

<b> 4th April </b>

[Our paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.3c03208) *A First-Principles Thermodynamic Model for the Ba‚ÄìZr‚ÄìS System in Equilibrium with Sulfur Vapor* is now available in Applied Energy Materials. Here we predict which temperatures and sulfur partial pressures are amenable to perovskite formation. And it is good news - we find that BaZrS3 is stable against degradation even at high sulfur partial pressures (which is required for stability of the the BaS3 liquid flux precursor).

<b> 21st March </b>

It's been Open Research Week at Northumbria. A chance to meet with colleagues from [library services open research](https://twitter.com/nuopenresearch), the Northumbria Reproducible, Open, And/or Replicable Research (ROAR) network and the wider [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org/).

<b> 9th February </b>

Today is the second installment of the [Rising Stars](https://mainstraem.github.io/) workshop at the Henry Royce Institute in Manchester. Henry Royce have been excellent in providing logistical and financial support so we can focus on the [workshop programme](https://www.royce.ac.uk/events/rising-stars-2024/) and reaching under-represented groups in materials science. 

<b> 8th January </b>

After two weeks of rest and relaxation with family over Christmas, it is time to start preparing teaching materials for a first year undergraduate course in Quantum Mechanics. The time investment is significant, however as someone whose research is based on repeatedly solving (an adapted version of) the Schr√∂dinger equation a chance to brush up on the fundamentals is welcome. 

<b>2023</b></br>

<b> 6th December </b>

[Ify](https://github.com/ifylala) finished her internship with us today. She has been contributing the our on-going "Singing Materials" project. Together (and alongside [Paul Vickers](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/v/paul-vickers/)) we have been developing a Python-based web application for sonification of phonon data: the sonification code for "Singing Materials" is [here](https://github.com/NU-CEM/singing-materials) and the web application (in development) is [here](https://github.com/NU-CEM/singing-materials-online).

<b> 1st November </b>

Preparations are beginning for another edition of "[Rising Stars in Materials Science](https://mainstraem.github.io/)". 

<b> 11th October </b>

 Today we (WISC- Women in Information Science and Computing) hosted a filming of "[Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film))" a.k.a the best film ever made. I've watched it about ten times, but never in a room of people about 15 years younger than me. It did make me realise it is *of its time*. Hack The Planet!

<b> 25th September </b>

And we are here - induction week begins! On Thursday we're welcoming returning students with a computational skills re-orientation using [ChooChoo the Checklist Tool](https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo). Nice to be back working with students again, especially after getting my Fellowship application done and dusted (fingers crossed).

<b> 20th August </b>

We are on our way back from London today (me and daughter Robin), after visiting the Institute of Physics for a family fun day: "Mimi's Rainbow Adventure". Lovely to feature in it as an ["Amazing science superhero"](https://www.iop.org/explore-physics/mimis-rainbow-adventure/green-energy-role-models), and to talk about my love of both science and reality TV. Now off to Sweden to speak at a summer school on [Finite Temperature and Anharmonic Response Properties](https://liu.se/en/research/tdep2023).

<b> 8th August </b>

Point defects in halide perovskites are difficult to model, and there are several conflicting reports (both from experiment and theory). I highlight the high sensitivity to available lattice relaxation pathways in "[Steric Engineering of Point Defects in Lead Halide Perovskites](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03516)", just out in Journal of Physical Chemistry C.

<b> 3rd July </b>

Now in Dublin for the [RSC Materials Chemistry conference MC16](https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/72840/16th-international-conference-on-materials-chemistry-mc16). With my out-of-office on, and no other diversions for a full week, this is also prime-time for fellowship application writing. 

<b> 28th June </b>

Back in Daresbury for the second time in 2023, this time for the [Materials Chemistry Consortium](https://mcc.hec.ac.uk/) annual conference. It's a remote spot in the North West of England where a national lab is hidden. You can get to it by bus from Warrington, or take the more adventurous route from Runcorn East by walking for about 45 minutes along canal towpaths. Lots of lovely farmland. 

<b> 31st May </b>

Today I'm giving a webinar as part of the Henry Royce Institute [stand-out skills programme](https://www.royce.ac.uk/students/stand-out-skills/). I'll be talking about building an open source website using Github+Jekyll+Markdown; for a recording, there is a Youtube vid [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrqFfccCMvE).

<b> 21st April </b>

Putting the finishing touches to a series of introductory tutorials for the [Open Science with the Atomic Simulation Environment](https://ase-workshop-2023.github.io/tutorial/)  summer school, running next week at Daresbury Labs in the UK.

<b> 4th March </b><br>

Hot off the press! Prakriti's second paper as a PhD student, and my first one with an experimental collaborator: [High Temperature Equilibrium of 3D and 2D Chalcogenide Perovskites](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/solr.202201078). We consider all competing phases in the Ba-Zr-S system and predict that the Ruddlesden Popper phases are likely to form during high temperature synthesis. This is confirmed experimentally via XRD and Raman, with [our database of Raman specta](https://github.com/NU-CEM/2022_BaZrS3_High-T_equilibrium) used to eliminate the possibility of other phases forming.

<b> 16th February </b><br>

New pre-print on ArXiv: [Steric engineering of point defects in lead halide perovskites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08412). This is an idea I have been working on since early 2020 (how time flies); namely, translating the concept of reorganisation energy from organic materials to inorganic and hybrid organic-inorganic materials. In the context of organics it is used to engineer for particular charge transport properties. In this work I propose it can be used to engineer charge trapping / de-trapping rates at point defects in crystalline materials which display large lattice relaxation. I also show that the usual defect classification of "deep", "inactive" and "shallow" is not so relevant in these materials. For accurate predictions I had to interpolate along atomic translations and molecular rotations; I have released the code that implements this [here](https://github.com/NU-CEM/Kabsch_interpolation). Thoughts and feedback on any and all are very welcome.

<b> 25th January </b><br>

New term, new teaching! We have developed a new Quantum Optics course for 3rd year undergraduates on the physics programme. As a newbie to quantum optics, learning about [MEEP](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has been a pleasure. We also have a nice Microsoft Azure setup for the students to use. Takes the pain out of installation, and the students can run it from any device with a browser and terminal.

<b>2022</b></br>

<b> 5th December </b><br>
Our latest work developed alongside experimental collaborator Giulia Longo (and others) is [now available](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01429) on the pre-print server ArXiv. We consider all competing phases in the Ba-Zr-S system and predict that the Ruddlesden Popper phases are likely to form during high temperature synthesis. This is confirmed experimentally via XRD and Raman, with our predicted Raman specta for all phases used to eliminate the possibility of other phases forming.

<b> 26th November </b><br>
Myself and Prakriti are heading to Boston for MRS Fall. I'll be presenting my latest results analysing the quantum mechanics of non-radiative carrier capture processes in mixed A-site cation perovskites. Prakriti will be presenting her work modelling the vibrational spectra of chalcogenide perovskites. 

<b> 10th October </b><br>
Deep in the autumn teaching term now. Still some time to update our [ThermoPot repository](https://github.com/NU-CEM/ThermoPot), which will hopefully be fully tested and available for wider use in the next few months...

<b> 11th September </b><br>
Yay! I've completed my induction period at Northumbria, and have been promoted to an Assistant Professor position :) 

<b> 31st August </b><br>
I'll be speaking on a panel at the [UK Research Software Engineering conference](https://rsecon2022.society-rse.org/) next week. We will be discussing "Developing the necessary skills to support the future of computational research" - something I've thought a fair bit amount since teaching Computational Physics at undergraduate level. Looking forward to meeting up with the very friendly RSE-crowd. 

<b> 29th July </b><br>
Very pleased to be speaking about A-site cation mixing and non-radiative carrier trapping at a special meeting celebrating 10 years of the [Material Design Group](https://wmd-group.github.io/) at Imperial. Great to see some old faces - just wish I could have been there in person..

<b> 21st June </b><br>
Our review paper ["Modelling interfaces in thin-film photovoltaic devices"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2022.920676) is out in Frontiers in Chemistry. A new collaboration with Newcastle (Toon) based scientists from Northumbria University and Newcastle University.

<b> 1st May </b><br>
I'm officially a <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/fellowship">Fellow of the Higher Education Academy</a> - this means I have attained the standards defined the <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/uk-professional-standards-framework-ukpsf">UK Professional Standards Framework</a> for teaching in higher education. You can find the reflective essay I wrote for my application <a href="https://lucydot.github.io/FHEA_essay/">here</a>.

<b>  29th April </b><br>
Today my good friend [David Mytton](https://davidmytton.blog/about/) visited Northumbria to talk about [Software engineering tools, sustainability, and academia](https://northumbriaresearchcomputing.github.io/Spring_Talk/). An excellent turn-out from Northumbria students and staff, with staff from the Newcastle RSE team joining us also. Nice to start building RSE connections in the North-East.

<b> 23rd March </b><br>
[Prakriti is presenting a poster](https://twitter.com/prakayastha314/status/1506782571140636673) "Following the reaction: computational spectroscopy of perovskite BaZrS3" at the Institute of Physics' [Advances in Photovoltaics conference](https://www.iopconferences.org/iop/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=1091274&eventID=1769&traceRedir=2) today. This is a warm-up project, building on Prakriti's existing expertise in lattice dynamics, to kick start her PhD work. Of course, the warm-up is turning into more of a work-out as we start to uncover more and more tempting science...

<b> 28th February </b><br>
We are putting the final touches on our review paper "The Physical Significance of Imaginary Phonon Modes in Crystals". Imaginary modes have a bad reputation ("your crystal is all wrong!") but they *can* contain a lot of useful physics - and in this review article we tell you how to access all that juicy information on phase transitions and dynamical disorder.

A pleasant end of year activity has been writing my application for fellowship of the Higher Education Academy. It has been a chance to reflect on my teaching this term. It has also encouraged me to read two excellent books: [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/) by [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) and [Small Teaching](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Small+Teaching%3A+Everyday+Lessons+from+the+Science+of+Learning%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119755548) by [James M.

<b> 30th November </b><br>
I'm coming to the end of teaching a [Theory and Computation](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys) course to second year Physics students at Northumbria. It's been a learning curve for all involved, and I've got improvements up my sleeve for next year's iteration - including an [automated Github-based workflow for monitoring student progress](https://nu-cem.github.io/CompPhys/2021/08/02/Python-progress.html). Now I'm looking forward to the rest over Christmas and a more research-intensive new year!

<b> 1st October </b><br>
A big welcome to [Prakriti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XIU5zG4AAAAJ&hl=en) who is joining us as a PhD student to work on energy materials modelling as part of the [CDT-ReNU](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). Her project will focus on modelling battery cathode materials in the spinel structure, but first we are taking a little de-tour into chalcogenide perovskites. 

<b> 30th September </b><br>
[SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.github.io/#/) has been running throughout this month, with a very full timetable of RSE-related talks (RSE = Research Software Engineering). I'm speaking today about the importance of, and practicalities around, publishing your code in a peer-reviewed journal like [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/) or [JORS](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/).

<b> 2nd August </b><br>
If you are a software developer then you better run and hide - I've joined the editorial board of the [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/) and will be pinging you for reviews soon. JOSS is a journal *of the future* - with a peer review process that is fully transparent (using Github issues) and designed to improve the quality of software submitted. I'll be talking more about JOSS at the [SeptembRSE conference](https://society-rse.org/events/septembrse/).

<b> 12th July </b><br>
Today I'm speaking about our latest paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" at the 15th International conference on materials chemistry (MC15). For those that couldn't attend you can find a recording of the same presentation [here](https://vimeo.com/575352468).

<b> 10th June </b><br>
I'm pleased to say that our paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" has been published open-access in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

<b> 6th May </b><br>
A pre-print for our new paper "Giant Huang-Rhys Factor for Electron Capture by the Iodine Interstitial in Perovskite Solar Cells" is [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02097). In this paper we analyse the quantum mechanics of carrier trapping at an abundant defect in the prototype hybrid perovskite "MAPI". Our main finding is that there is large lattice relaxation after carrier capture, leading to a Huang-Rhys factor (a proxy for electron-phonon coupling) exceeding 300 and fast electron capture. This suggests that suppression of the large octahedral rotations associated with the lead-iodide cage is an important factor to enhance photovoltaic performance. 

<b> 7th April </b><br>
Next week (14/4) I'm speaking at the Institute of Physics conference ["Lessons Learnt in Lockdown: Teaching computational physics in 2020 and beyond"](http://lessonslearnedinlockdown.iopconfs.org/1021126). I'll introduce the pedagogy used in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lessons, and reflect on a carpentry-based workshop I have delivered both in and out of lockdown, [Python for Physicists](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice/). Software Carpentry takes inspiration from the world of open-source software, developing lesson materials collaboratively and making them available for anyone to re-use, adapt and extend. I dream of a future where most university education is developed and delivered in a similar way...

<b> 8th March </b><br>
We've just released a new version of [effmass](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass) with support for FHI-aims calculations. Thanks to Matthias Golomb for contributing the necessary code. Castep is next, watch this space. UPDATE: effmass 2.0.0 supports Vasp, Castep, FHI-aims and ASE. It also comes with a command line interface..

<b> 23rd November</b></br>
I'm preparing to deliver my first online teaching session, and first time teaching as a faculty member. It's a course I'm familiar with ([Programming in Python](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice), adapted from the Software Carpentry course), but I'm wondering how well the "live coding" approach will work: me talking + screenshare with the code I am typing + students' jupyter notebook + chat window / website / other useful course materials seems a lot for a small laptop screen...

<b> 10th November</b> </br>
I'll be delivering a seminar at the University of Oklahoma Centre for Quantum Research and Technology this Friday (13th November). I'll be talking about nonparabolic effective mass, and the effect this has on the optical and transport properties of photovoltaic materials - the corresponding paper is [here](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.085207).  

<b> 1st October</b> </br>

<b>1st June</b> </br>
Today is my first official day as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow at Northumbria University. I'm on maternity leave until October, but happy to stop thinking about baby Robin for a little while and attend the online induction events. With lots of events moving online it's been easy for me to keep a toe in the academic waters.

<b>12th March</b></br>
Our CarrierCapture.jl software has been accepted for publication with [the Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). The accompanying paper can be found [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02102).

<b>17th March</b></br>
I have been awarded the [Thomas Young Centre](https://www.thomasyoungcentre.org/) at Imperial prize: "An annual award to the student who has demonstrated the most important and innovative contribution to research in the Theory and Simulation of Materials". A special thanks to the Walsh group post-docs who worked with and supported me through my PhD (including [Jarvist Frost](https://jarvist.github.io/), [Jonathan Skelton](https://skelton-group.github.io/), [Sunghyun Kim](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=v438vEAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Ji-Sang Park](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ZCmm3y8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Samantha Hood](https://www.samanthahood.com.au/)). I think the prize money should be spent on thousands of Lindt Lindor chocolates.

<b>13th January</b></br>
I have been awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy! It's been the most productive four years of my life, and very enjoyable to boot: a huge thanks to my supervisor [Prof. Aron Walsh and his team](http://wmd-group.github.io/) at Imperial College London.

<b>2019</b></br>

<b>25th November</b></br>
I'm happy to announce that I will be joining Northumbria University as a Vice-Chancellor's fellow in the department of [Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/mathematics-physics-and-electrical-engineering/research/), and aligned with the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). I'm very excited to see what future research projects and collaborations will bring!

<b>14th November</b></br>
Today I'm teaching version control using Git at Imperial College London. It's fully booked but you can follow the material yourself using the course webpage which is [here](https://kmichali.github.io/2019-11-14-Imperial/) and the slides which are [here](https://lucydot.github.io/slides/1911_git/SWC_git_1911.pdf).

<b>5th October</b></br>
From the 5th October until the 9th of November I will be visiting the [Laboratory for Materials and Structures](https://www.msl.titech.ac.jp/english/member/profile/oba_en.html) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. We hope to develop software for the high-throughput calculation of non-radiative recombination rates, and builds on the [CarrierCapture software](https://github.com/WMD-group/CarrierCapture.jl) developed by the Walsh group at Imperial. 

<b>1st October</b></br>
From the 5th of October 2019 until the 26th of January 2020 DotSpace will be exhibited at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, The Row Gallery and Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum as part of the Coventry Biennial.  To accompany the exhibition I am developing a DotSpace web app (aka The Grain Generator) so that visitors can generate their own DotSpace picture - the web app can be found [here](https://boiling-peak-32563.herokuapp.com/voila/render/dotspace.ipynb). More information about the exhibition can be found [here](https://www.theherbert.org/whats_on/1490/coventry_biennial__the_twin).
