As a computational scientist a significant part of my time is spent writing code. Some of this code is written to submit and manage calculations which run on various supercomputers (primarily [Archer, the UK national supercomputer](http://www.archer.ac.uk/)), and some is used to analyse and extract meaning from the output of these calculations (numbers --> physics). 
Like many scientists, I am a self-taught programmer and have had very little in the way of training. The two things which have had the highest impact on the quality of code I write are: 1) teaching basic programming skills ([Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/)) to other researchers; 2) submitting a package ([effmass]((http://github.com/lucydot/effmass))) to the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/), a peer-reviewed journal for research code.

The code I write relies heavily upon open source tools, some of which are listed on my [personal roadmap](https://lucydot.github.io/blog/roadmap/).
Through a fellowship with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) I am collaborating with [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) to develop resources so that other researchers have the skills in place to publish their code.
